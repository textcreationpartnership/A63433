            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </gap> found about him: By which is apparently Discovered, how Indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable and Couragious those Hellish Blood-Hounds are in their Endeavours and Practices▪ in Contriving and Executing of all manner of Wickedness, though to the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes, to bring to Perfection their most Horrid Machinations, and worse than <hi>Matchivilian</hi> Designs.</head>
            <head type="sub">But not to tire the Readers Patience with a Prolix Preamble, take the Relation as followeth.</head>
            <p>ON <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning last, one <hi>Stiff,</hi> a Constable of the Parish of St. <hi>Martins</hi> in the Fields, and <hi>Sebastian Jones</hi> a Bailiff, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <hi>Daniel Mac-Carte,</hi> an <hi>Irish</hi> Priest, near the Square in St. <hi>James</hi>'s Fields, in the instant that he was preparing to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise his Function to a Lady, who being at the point of Death, had sent for him to give her Extream Unction; they surprized him by her Bed-side, and his Priestly Habiliments under the Bed; 'tis thought if they had been but a little later, they had taken him drest in all his Pontificalibus. When they had seized him, not knowing who to apply themselves to, they carried him to his Royal Highness's <hi>Coffee-house</hi> at <hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> who sent to Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> was not to be found, but Doctor <hi>Oates</hi> came immediately; and so soon as he saw <hi>Mac Carte,</hi> he called him by his name, and said, that to his knowledge he was a Priest, and had taken Orders from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101913:2"/>the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and advised the Constable to have him before Sir <hi>William Waller;</hi> who after he had caused him to be Searched, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to the <hi>Gatehouse,</hi> upon which he seemed to be very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, being very Pale and Trembling. They found about him a standing Crucifix, only proper for Itinerant Priests, and a Writing, containing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions how the Papists should behave themselves upon their Tryals, how they should plead in such and such Cases; and to what sense they should express themselves at the place of Execution, as also Directions by what Means, Arts and Insinuations they might best Invalidate the Testimony of Mr. <hi>Oates, Bedloe, Dugdale,</hi> and the rest of the Evidence. Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> took a Copy of that part of the Instructions which particularly related to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validating of his Testimony. The Constable and Bailiff unadvisedly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to secure the Vestments which were under the Bed, when they came back, by Order of Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> to search for, and secure whatsoever they should suspect appertained to the Priest, not only the aforesaid Vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but some Writings also which they had observed in the Room when they apprehended him, were removed, and (as it is verily believed) to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambassadors House.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Mac Carte</hi> aforesaid, about three quarters of a year since, was taken and Committed to <hi>Yarmouth</hi> Gaol, from whence he was Bailed, and leaving his Bail at hazard made his Escape to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> from whence he lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with fresh Instructions as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>Such Circumstances as these induce us to believe, that the Papists are so far from being discouraged in their hopes of perpetrating their late Horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, that they still proceed in it and pursue it, with fresh vigour.</p>
